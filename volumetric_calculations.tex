\section{Description}
This document describes calculations for volumetric measurment of biogas.
As with manometric methods, two methods are commonly used and both are described here: one based on normalized \ce{CH4} concentrations (method 1) and one that explicitly includes estimation of \ce{CH4} in the bottle headspace (method 2).
Expected results from the two methods are identical; differences are due only to error in measurement of biogas composition or headspace volume.
Both methods are available through the \texttt{cumBg()} function in the biogas package \cite{softwarex} and through the web application OBA (\url{https://biotransformers.shinyapps.io/oba1/}) and can be easily added to, e.g., a spreadsheet template.

\section{Standardization of measured gas volume}
Both methods use the same approach for standardization of gas volume.
Dry biogas volume in a bottle's headspace before and after venting is calculated by correcting for water vapor, temperature, and pressure.
First the measured gas volume (e.g., in a syringe or hanging water column) is converted to dry conditions at standard pressure:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:h2ocorrection}
  V_{dry} = V_{headspace}(P_{meas} - P_{H_2O})/101.325 \unit{kPa}
\end{equation}
where $P_{meas}$ is the measured headspace pressure and $P_{H_2O}$ the water vapor partial pressure (both in kPa).
Eq. (\ref{eq:h2ocorrection}) is an expression of Boyle's law.
The value of $P_{H_2O}$ is assumed to be the saturation vapor pressure, and can be calculated using, e.g., the Magnus-form equation given below (Eq. 21 in \cite{magnus}):

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:magnus}
   P_{H_2O} = 0.61094 e^{(17.625 T/(243.04 + T))}
\end{equation}
where T is temperature in $^\circ$C.
Volume is then further standardized to 273.15 K by application of Charles's law:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:bgstd}
  V_{std} = V_{dry} 273.15 \unit{K}/T_{meas}
\end{equation}
where $V_{std}$ is the standardized volume of gas within a bottle's headspace at the time of pressure measurement.
Interval biogas production $V_{biogas, i}$ is taken as this standardized volume $v_{std}$.
Cumulative production is taken as the cumulative sum of interval values. 

\section{Calculation of \ce{CH4} production}
\subsection{Method 1}
In the first method, biogas is assumed to consist of only \ce{CH4} and \ce{CO2} at the time of production (i.e., as produced by the microbial community) and \ce{CH4} production is calculated from vented (removed) biogas only.
This method is described in \cite{brian1991}.
Coupled with the assumption that all gas production is biogas, this provides the simplest approach for calculating \ce{CH4} production.

First, concentrations of \ce{CH4} and \ce{CO2} are adjusted so they sum to 1.0:
\begin{equation}
  x_{CH_4, n} = x_{CH_4}/(x_{CH_4} + x_{CO_2})
\end{equation}
where $x_{CH_4}$ and $x_{CO_2}$ are the measured \ce{CH4} and \ce{CO2} concentrations as volume (mole) fraction (possibly including a correction for water vapor--this has no effect here) and $x_{CH_4, n}$ is the normalized \ce{CH4} volume fraction.

Methane production in an interval $i$ is then calculated as
\begin{equation}
  V_{CH_4, i} = x_{CH_4, n} V_{biogas, i}
\end{equation}
Cumulative production is taken as the cumulative sum of interval values. 

\subsection{Method 2}
Method 2 relies on fewer assumptions, but requires the true concentration of \ce{CH4} (volume fraction) of \ce{CH4} within the bottle headspace, with correction only for water vapor.
Here, \ce{CH4} production in an interval has two components: a vented part that is naturally interval, and a residual headspace part, that is naturally cumulative:
\begin{equation}
  V_{CH_4, i} = V_{CH_4, v, i} + ( V_{CH_4, HSR, i} - V_{CH_4, HSR, i-1} )
\end{equation}
where the subscript $v$ indicates vented volume and $HSR$ = residual headspace volume (post-venting).

Vented \ce{CH4} is calculated from:
\begin{equation}
  V_{CH_4, v, i} = x_{CH_4, n, i} V_{biogas, i}
\end{equation}

Headspace \ce{CH4} is calculated from:
\begin{equation}
  V_{CH_4, HSR, i} = x_{CH_4, n, i} V_{post, i}
\end{equation}
where $V_{post}$ is the post-venting standardized volume of gas in the bottle headspace.

Cumulative production is taken as the cumulative sum of interval values.
